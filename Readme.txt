For running the software you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you should have the necessary libraries available, which are `tkinter` and `nmap`.

1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

2. tkinter: `tkinter` is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. Most Python installations include `tkinter` by default. However, if you find that `tkinter` is missing, you might need to install it separately depending on your operating system.

- For Windows: `tkinter` is usually bundled with Python installations on Windows.
- For macOS: `tkinter` is generally included in the standard Python installation on macOS.
- For Linux: You might need to install the appropriate package, which is typically named `python3-tk` or similar, through your package manager.

3. nmap: `nmap` is a network scanning tool that this code uses to scan the network and identify connected devices. To use `nmap` with Python, you'll need to install the `python-nmap` library, which acts as a wrapper for the `nmap` tool.

You can install the required `python-nmap` library using pip:
```
pip install python-nmap
```

Once you have Python, tkinter, and the `python-nmap` library installed, you can run the code. Save the code in a file, for example, `network_scanner.py`, and execute it using the command:
```
python network_scanner.py
```
